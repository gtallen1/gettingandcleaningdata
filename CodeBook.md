#Getting and Cleaning Data - CodeBook

variables for loading data:

1. subjectTrain.....loads subject_train.txt
2. dataTrain........loads X_train.txt
3. labelTrain.......loads y_train.txt
4. subjectTest......loads subject_test.txt
5. dataTest.........loads X_test.txt
6. labelTest........loads y_test.txt
7. features.........loads features.txt
8. activity.........loads activity_labels.txt

variables for merging data:

1. mergeData........merges dataTrain and dataTest
2. mergeLabel.......merges labelTrain and labelTest
3. mergeSubject.....merges subjectTrain and subjectTest

variable for creating mean and standard deviation index file:

1. meanStdIndices

variable for activity label:

1. activityLabel

variables for the tidy data files, which are the merged subject,
    label, and data files
    
1. cleanData........initial complete file
2. aveData..........final average data file

Data files used in this project:

1. features.txt.........List of all features
2. activity_labels.txt..Links the class labels with their activity name
3. subject_train.txt....Each row identifies the subject who performed
                        the activity for each window sample.
                        Its range is from 1 to 30.
4. subject_test.txt.....Same as subject_train.txt
5. X_train.txt..........Training set
6. y_train.txt..........Training labels
7. X_text.txt...........Test set
8. y_test.txt...........Test labels

Transformations:

1. Test and training sets merged
2. Mean and standard deviation measurements extracted
3. Activity and variable names given descriptive labels
4. Tidy data sets created - complete and average values
